# Advertisement-prediction-model
LifeLux Inc. is building a model to better understand the relationship between advertisement and unit sales.

#Steps  

 1.Imported the libraries(Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Pandas) required for the project.

2. Perfomed exploratory data analysis on the advertising dataset to find correlation and relationship between advertisement channels.

3. Implemented the train_test_split process for the dataset using sklearn.model_selection class.

4. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression to predict the model.

5.from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

6.Determined the performance of our machine. 

7. Calculated difference between the actual and predicted to help determine if the residual line is a good fit 

8. Plotted the relationship between the advertisement channels.

9. Saved and shared the model with my team.
